## Modern Stack Overview

This handbook covers the following technology stack:

- **Frontend**: React â†’ Next.js (SSR, file-based routing, API routes)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (clean architecture, JWT auth)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma (type-safe ORM, migrations)
- **Caching**: Redis (performance optimization, session management)
- **DevOps**: Docker + Cloud deployment (Railway, Render, Neon, Upstash)

## Who This Book is For

- **Students** learning how real-world applications are built
- **Hackathon builders** who need to go from idea to demo in a weekend
- **Startup developers** building MVPs that can scale

Each chapter offers:
- Clear explanations of the technology
- Visual diagrams
- Hands-on exercises
- Mini projects to practice

## Getting Started

Start with the [Introduction](01-introduction.md) to understand why modern full-stack frameworks matter, then work through each chapter sequentially. Each chapter builds on the previous ones, culminating in a complete, deployable application.

## Key Takeaway

Modern full stack frameworks are about speed, reliability, and focus. They help you spend less time on setup and more time on building what matters.
